# Dev Companion

This project is a desktop application that will give developers a tool to greatly reduce the amount of time needed to configure and deploy locally hosted cloud apps. 

Intended features include:
 - Onboarding workflow with step-by-step guidance for developers to setup their local environment for deploying projects locally (websites, fabric cluster, etc). 
- Sharing scripts (Powershell, command prompt).
- Script templating allowing variables editable in UI 
- allow storing locally & syncing with Azure App Config.
- Sharing team & project documentation (Architecture, features, coding standards, etc).
- Health report that will verify required SDKs/configurations are installed/setup as expected for Team/project.
- Event driven triggers to run specified scripts on specified events (file updates, button in UI, git commit, etc).
